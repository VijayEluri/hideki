seriously, take the other yelper's advice and don't come here.  i don't want to wait any longer than I already had to...

in all seriousness, this is the best, no bullshit, sushi i've had since moving to the bay area.  you won't find any of the sauce drenched fru-fru, tiger/dragon/catepillar/(other animal) rolls here.  just good, authentic stuff.

its super tiny so not really ideal for groups of 4 or more.  the sushi chefs are all japanese which is a super good thing in my book.

but anyway, stop reading about how great this place is.  i don't need more people going.

thanks.

I LOVE this place! I recently went with my girlfriends to this cute place -

Awesome Philadelphia rolls, Uni and Hamachi Kama - my favorite!

It's so hard to find that anywhere these days.

The service was great - the prices even better.

I recommend this to anyone looking for fresh, cheap sushi.

The other yelpers are right--don't come here.  And I mean that not because I "want the place to myself," but because I think the sushi is substandard, and you deserve better.  In fact, there *is* better sushi in this city, far better, and you don't have to wait an eternity to eat it.

They had that "I've been frozen one too many times" taste to it, and was cut into these strange, jagged chunks.  Taking a peek inside of the little area where the chef keeps the fish, you find slabs of fish strewn about at random, no finesse involved here at all.  

Sushi is about fresh fish, and this place ain't got it.  If you're a fan of long waits, mayo, rolls, and mushy sloppily cut sushi, this place is all yours.  Sorry, SZ, I honestly wish you were as good as your reputation.

I found my new favorite sushi place! This place is tiny. We got here around 5:05 (they open at 5:00pm) and got the last seats in the place. The people after us, who came in 2 or 3 minutes behind us,had to wait probably 30/45 mins to get food. There's 8 seats at the bar, and 2 tables by the windows...unless you get here right when it opens, be prepared to wait.

BUT it's well worth it. I generally don't get rolls out in the Bay anymore due to overseasoning (too much sauce, mayonnaise) that overpowers the taste of the fish. But Sushi Zone's rolls are delectable! 

I had the salmon with spciy mayonnaise and mango...it was too die for. The balance of salmon, sweet mango, and spicy mayonnaise sounds simple but tastes amazing. 

We also ordered an abundance of nigiri. The yellow-tail and albacore (white tuna) was especially fresh and literally melted in my mouth. The uni was really good too. The only nigiri that wasn't as fresh as the others was the salmon, which generally would ruin my experience, but the other stuff I ordered was so mind-blowingly good, I didn't mind the mediocre salmon nigiri. My recommendation is to ask the chef what's fresh for the day.

We also got a seabass with mango in the mussel shell appetizer which was the perfect way to start the meal.

I thought Sushi Time down the street was really good until I tried Sushi Zone. The atmosphere at Sushi Time is more romantic, but for a delicious sushi dinner, definitely try this place. Just be prepared to wait!

Also note that it's only open for dinner.

It was like 10pm and we still had to wait for 45 mins to sit down.  There is really just one sushi chef, and he does each order/table one by one. So we had to wait at least another 45 mins before we had our first dish. Its not like the chef was busting his ass either, he was fussing over the music, drinking some sake in between, etc.

The fish was definitely fresh and the sushi was delicious.  I am not a big fan of rolls in the first place, however they were pretty cheap here.  The selection of fish was also limited. 

Although the fish was good, I still can't justify for the long wait.

The Good
Flavors are above average

The Bad
Long wait to get a seat, long wait for food. My party waited for 30 minutes to get a seat (a short wait for this restaurant, I'm told), and after 40 minutes sitting at the seat, was told that our sushi order hadn't even started. After 15 minutes of waiting, our baked mussel arrived. After asking if our order had been started, we told them not to bother making the rest of the order and we just paid and left. We did not even get an apology.

The Ugly
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate good food that takes time. But take it from me. Sushi requires a lot of time and patience in fish selection and ingredient preparation, but these all happen before the actual making of the sushi. The actual making of the sushi, while requiring great skill, does not require great time.

Avoid this place at all costs, unless you have at least 2.5 hours to spend on food here or are a hipster who thinks that 2.5 hours to wait "totally gives the place character, man". There are many many places that serve sushi of equal or greater quality with better wait times, better service, and greater selection.

You have been warned.

Please don't go here, it is not worth you waiting in line sometimes over an hour.  Or at least that is that i hope as it is my favorite sushi spot in the city and maybe the best sushi i have had in a long time.

I almost rated this fine establishment with only one star as i would like to keep this a neighborhood secret, but i have a feeling at it already has over 600+ reviews, that time is fleeting.  So, i guess after a couple of years, i must share this little piece of sunshine and tasty goodness.

Tips to ensure a happy experience:
1) Expect to wait 30 min if u arrive after 6pm
2) Try the Halibut starter
3) The salmon is simply amazing
4) Ask to try the scallop without the spicy sauce

oh so mummy to say the very least

This place probably suffered from overhype, as a lot of people have recommended it to me over the past year.  I thought the sushi was good but not spectacular.  And I'm irritated by any place that requires a minimum 45 minute wait on a weeknight because it won't take reservations.  Basically, the food didn't justify the wait in my book.  Oh and for the love of god, don't bring a group here.  There was a group of 6 in line in front of us when we arrived -- they were still there when we left....

No reservations. 1-2 hour long wait but it is worth it.  Like any restaurant, you have to order properly.  Here are the stars at Sushi Zone:

-striped bass mango
-seaweed salad
-jalapeño albacore
-stuffed shitake
-spicy hamachi
-spicy mango
-Hawaiian #2
-spider roll

The sushi and cooked appetizers are fresh, inventive and worth every minute if the wait.  This is a small place with 8 seats at the bar and two tabletops for groups of 4.  

No tempura, no noodles.  But the best hole in the wall sushi place in SF.

Sushi Zone has been bookmarked for places to try for over a year. As the near year began, I wanted to tackle as many places to try on my growing list of bookmarks. When the opportunity came up to get sushi, I went to my bookmarks and went with Sushi Zone. Reading the reviews of the long wait was somewhat of a deterrent but if I wanted to knock Sushi Zone off my list, I just had to SUCK IT UP!

Luckily, I didn't have to wait too long since Matt L. was waiting on a table while I got off work, drove to Sushi Zone and found parking.  It is street parking in the area so it's the luck of the draw you find good parking. Sushi Zone is SMALL...REALLY SMALL! It seats 8 people at the bar and 2 booths with 4 seats in each...for a grand whopping total of 16 seats for the patrons to fight over. I got there a little late so Matt L. had to give our seat away to the next people on the list since the whole party has to be present for them to seat you. We ended up waiting another 30 minutes before we got seated. 

We got seated in the booth that fits 4 so we got a couple of nasty glares when we sat down. I thought we had to communal with another party but we had the whole booth to ourselves. The waitress came over and got us started with drinks, we had a large Sapporo. That came quickly and we were ready to order when she came back. We ordered the, Baked Mussells, Baked Bass, Spicy Hamachi Roll, Hawaiian Roll #2, Papaya Unagi, Scallop Roll and Sake (Salmon) Nigiri. 

The appetizers, Baked Mussells and Baked Bass came first. The Baked Bass was good but not really really good. The bass was a little over cooked so it had the tough feeling. I enjoyed the mango in the bass though. The Baked Mussells was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked! It was buttery good, wished I got 2 more. These are both baked and served in a mussell shell. (See http://www.yelp.com/bi... and here http://www.yelp.com/bi...).

It took a while for the rest of our rolls to come but we expected it since this place was PACKED and there is only one sushi chef behind the counter working his butt off. The rest of our rolls soon came in a big platter, Spicy Hamachi Roll (http://www.yelp.com/bi...), Hawaiian Roll #2 (http://www.yelp.com/bi...), and Papaya Unagi (http://www.yelp.com/bi...). Everything was super delicious and fresh. The Hawaiian Roll #2 was what I was looking forward to due to all the suggestions on Yelp and it did live up to the hype. The macadamia nuts on top added a great contrasting texture to the soft melt in your mouth goodness of the roll.

We took a quick break from the food and got another beer, this time an Asahi. We flagged down our waitress (there's only one working the entire restaurant) and ordered 2 more dishes. We waited 25 minutes for the rest of our food to come. The Sake Nigiri (http://www.yelp.com/bi...) was melt in your mouth good. The Scallop Roll (http://www.yelp.com/bi...) was my least favorite dish of the night, the scallop was super slimy and the texture was just weird to me. 

All in all, the meal took around 2.5 hours with waiting and eating. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the service at Sushi Zone. The food was fresh and a little different from other Japanese restaurants (fruit in the dishes) and the service was attentive. Props to our waitress for working so hard. It's CASH ONLY. I will definitely be back the next time I don't mind waiting for some BOMB Japanese food.

No one should come here! It is crowded enough as is and goddamn it, I want it to myself! I nearly die of anticipation when I put my name on the list and swallow the fact that I will most likely be in for a 45 minute wait. Waiting this long for sushi seems preposterous, I know, but Sushi Zone is SO. WORTH. IT. 

Everyone thinks of themselves as a sushi snob, but I, like, really am for real. And so, when I say this sushi is the best in the city, you know I speak the truth.

Fantastic fantastic sushi. Nothing like the stuff I've tasted along the east coast.

I recommend everything others recommended:
Hawaiian roll #1
Hawaiian roll #1
Spicy Hamachi
Spicy Tuna
Baked mussels
Baked bass. 

+ try the amaebi nigiri if they have it. They fry the head for you and it is delciousness. 

The use of mango here is amazing. Boyfriend and I were in San Fran for a week and this was the only restaurant we went to TWICE. 

Price is right. We were out for 60 bucks max with 2 bottles of beer. The place has limited seating and does get crowded fast, but luckily we were always seated without much wait.  

The ambience is really authentic and it's quite a cozy place. There seems to be a couple of regulars and there's a friendly atmosphere. It seems to be quite the date spot for San Fran, so expect many couples. 

It opens at 5pm, so come close around that time. It will be so worth it.

Waited about 1 1/2 hours to eat here tonight. it was friday, my wife warned me, so we put our name in and got a at the bar about a block away at market and laguna (nice little place) - the wait is insane, way longer than anyone should have to wait to get a table...this place would benefit from 1 more sushi chef (there is only one guy for the whole place), this would speed things up a bit, but also destroy the charm. 

That being said - this was perhaps the best sushi i've had to date. It's simple, the fish is pretty top quality (some of the best i've had), tastes like it should, i dont know who would say otherwise, i've been to many of the 'best' places in the state and this fish was far and away better than 95% of them. and those portions!!!! wow 

RAINBOW ROLL = $14, but its the size of a burrito - imagine two full orders of thick cut sashimi put over a solid crab/avo/tobiko roll - WOW! highly recommend, the rest of the rolls were pretty epic as well, 

and the setting - amazing, you feel like your in your sushi chef friend's living room. 

Only downfall - too small, too many people, DO NOT come here if you are impatiently hungry, you will be pissed, come ready to wait and you'll leave very very happy, and stuffed.

Food = 5+ stars
Service = 3 stars

I got some Miso Soup (could have been a bit hotter), and drank it.  Yup, no spoons here, folks.

The Hawaiian Roll #1. SO. DELICIOUS.  Perfect amount of soft sushi with a powerful tuna taste mixed with the nutty, salty top.  OMG.

Spicy Tuna was just so fresh and delicious...best I ever had.

Make sure when you go here, you wait around instead of going someplace else and getting drinks to pass the time.  Because you might have to wait over 1.5 hours to get seated (with a group of 4) rather than 45 minutes.  Just saying.

Food: 4
Service: 3

We arrived at 4:45PM and stood in line for the 5PM opening. We didn't get seated until 6:15PM and didn't receive our rolls until 6:45PM. There are only two 4-person tables and 7 seats around the sushi bar total. Expect a long wait to get seated.

Good sushi rolls once we were seated. Didn't try the sashimi.  Fish and eel cuts were tasty and not drowned out by sauces.

Cash only. Cheap rolls with a little too much rice per roll.

You'll have a shorter wait and similar quality at a number of other locations. Food was good, but the long wait detracted from the overall night.

This place is a gem. Living around the corner makes it so easy to go here often for wonderful, fresh sushi. They also have the best seaweed salad I have ever tasted. They open at 5pm, but people start showing up long before they are ready to open their door. The place is small, so you could have to wait for seating. It will be well worth the wait. Excellent service too! Love this place.

Literally a "hole-in-the-wall" restaurant off of Market Street. Delicious sushi and quick service. I had the combo plate with the baked sea bass and mango in an oyster shell (SO GOOD). Make sure you show up as soon as it opens so that you can grab a spot, or else you'll have to put your name down and wait for a table. The wait is worth it, though.

Best sushi I've had in San Francisco so far.  Maybe even the best I've had between here and Canada.  Definitely worth checking out if you're ever in town.

This is literally the best sushi in SF. Since moving from the city I now come here almost every time I do find myself in the neighborhood, with near religious devotion. Last time I was here I ordered 5 orders of my favorite baked mango / sea bass appetizer. The waitress was a bit surprised until we explained that I had moved to the country. "Oh, yes, I get that all the time," she said with a smile. LOL

This place has not  changed a bit in the last 10ish years I have been going. YUM. Can't wait to go again tonight. 

Don't come here expecting to find seating for a party of more than 4 people. Also, you should try and arrive as close to 5 as possible as there is usually a wait and that is the best time to slip in before the "rush" ... expect to wait a bit, it's worth it.

Really cute little place in Hayes Valley. Definitely call ahead if you can (it seemed like the waitress was taking phone rezies), since otherwise, you'll end up waiting about an hour, even if you get there right when dinner starts cranking up. Nice date place if you want to just chitchat for a long time, haha.

It's fun watching the sushi chef and his apprentice slice up the fish since they do it so fast and so prettily. I think I got the Hawaiian #2 roll and another roll with unagi (it's dying out, but it's too frackin' tasty...). Somehow the sushi here was on another level than sushi I've had elsewhere. It might just be ambience + the longgg wait making me delusional, but I swear it's good.

Delicious. Affordable. Fresh. Generous portions. Such a teeny tiny little place you likely won't get in without waiting forever, or showing up early, or getting lucky. But it's worth a long wait if you're able to get in, because this is some of the best sushi I've had in SF.

"Get in the Zone..... Sushi Zone!"

We waited about an hour and half to be seated. Based on what I hear and what I've seen regardless of when you go there will always be a wait. It's worth it.

Here's what we ordered:

Baked Sea Bass- a hit. Baked with Mangoes and cream sauce that wasn't too heavy or too salty.
Papaya Unagi- I'm a huge fan of eel, so I thought this would be my favorite, but either the taste of the unagi over powered the papaya or vice versa. I could taste the unagi, but something about the flavor combinations canceled each other out.
Hamachi Roll- Standard, but fresh fresh fish.
Hawaiian Roll (think that's what it's called. I don't remember and they don't have the menu online)- albacore tuna, mango, scallions, macadamia nuts. The best roll that we picked! The ingredients make it seem like an unlikely good combination, but the roll itself was delish. 

I like how they serve their patrons. They bring out each item ordered one at a time. Good because I feel that it gives diners time to enjoy the tastes of each dish/roll. They really are putting you in the "sushi zone" aren't they? Har har.

I should start a good things are worth the wait list. In honor of Sushi Zone, I think I will.

Oishii.....delicious fresh fish!

It was Friday evening and we were at Pearl and Market St. looking lost.  The owner of a Chinese restaurant at the corner there, without saying a word, came outside and pointed a little ways down Pearl Street. 
So I guess we looked like sushi connoisseurs ;o)

...AND there it was...SUSHI ZONE behind bushy ficus trees.  

Put our name on the list and waited 45 minutes for seating.
 
The server takes all orders even if you're sitting at the sushi bar leaving the one sushi chef uninterrupted to make his creations for the whole restaurant.  There is a wait for your food, but it is part of the whole experience.  Order some edamame and a tall Sapporo to pass the time.

Ordered spicy tuna roll, Hawaiian Roll #2, unagi/papaya roll and masago.  All the sushi pieces were large--each took two bites to eat.  Along with the fresh fish, crunchy nori (seaweed), ripe avocado and papaya.  No messy rolls drenched in sauces.

Facts:  CASH ONLY / 9 sushi bar seats / 2 tables of four

I was probably expecting too much as I was told by friends for years that this is their favorite sushi place in SF and there's always a line. The first time I tried to eat here, it was 8pm when the wait was over an hour so I didn't wait. I came back today when it opened and was quickly seated at the bar. 

I ordered the spicy hamachi roll and hawaiian roll no. 2 (albacore tuna, mango, and macadamia nuts). The friendly Japanese sushi chef quickly made and handed my sushi to me. The spicy hamachi tasted like ceviche with the lime and wasn't very spicy. The mangoes were very sweet as I saw the chef toss out the bad mangoes from the batch. The rolls contained a lot of rice compared to minced fish, which might be why the rolls were only $6.50. However, the rice was mushy today making the sushi not very good. 

I also tried the baked mussels and baked sea bass with mango ($5.50 each). Considering that the appetizers were baked in a toaster oven, they were tasty, but I didn't expect the mussels and sea bass to be chopped up. I thought I would get a whole piece of mussel and a cut or small fillet of sea bass. Instead, the sea bass was chopped, mixed and baked with cheesy mayo and mangoes in a mussel shell; the resulting baked sea bass tasted more like mayo than fish.

3 simple reasons I frequent this [45 min - 1 hour wait] venue:

No one glances at my direction twice for being severely underdressed [I come after the gym] unlike some other Japanese restaurants *cough* Ozumo *cough*.

Their Amaebi Nigiri is among the best I've ever had. It comes freshly prepared with a perfect hint of natural sweetness that coats your tastebuds like a pleasant forgotten memory. In conjunction with the requisite amount of viscosity, it makes for the most delightful treat when ingested prior to the fried shrimp head. I'd gladly devour those shrimp [brain] guts anyday.

Don't even get me started on the mangoes. Luscious, golden food fitting only for gods, this tropical fruit ranges high on my must-eat-on-a-daily list. Sushi Zone has masterfully integrated this natural sugar infested fruit into many of their creatively fabricated rolls. Not being a huge fan of specialty rolls [crouching tiger hidden dragon roll, hot love roll, etc] or anything other than sashimi + nigiri, I surprisingly found myself thoroughly enjoying every bite and more. Unlike the other exceedingly posh Jap eateries, their rolls aren't doused in flavored mayonnaise. If I wanted spicy mayo overpowering my overcooked  rice, flavorless slivers of raw [think stale] fish and additional unnecessary condiments, I would have went to Sushi Bistro or another similar trendy "sushi" joint.

In a nutshell, Sushi Zone = no thrills, zero frills, just good sushi.

This place has very good cuts of fish that are very fresh. The flavors of their rolls are insanely good. I will definitely be a regular. The only negative is the size of the place. I wish they would expand or change locations to accommodate their ever growing patronage.

It smells like japan, it feels like japan, if the sushi didnt have mango and macadamias in it and was in japan, it would be japan.....

I love Sushi Zone.  It IS EXPENSIVE but the food makes me smile and makes my ladycakes smile which is all you really want from food.

The Mango whatever is a perfect complement to the salmon it is paired with and the macadamia maki is to die for.

The staff are so friendly and make you feel at home....

Let's Sushi Zone!

show up at 4:45pm.  Fat Koreans show up at 4:38pm.   SZ opens @ 5pm and accommodates 8  at the sushi bar; 2  table tops that can seat 4 each.  If you are later than 4:45pm, you will wait an hour at the very least. 

A harmonious blend of hot tea, a few choices of good sake, and fantastically fresh fish.  There is one sushi chef working along side 1-2 assistants...no speaking...just smooth movements....almost like ninjas but they don't cut you.  

The mussel with mango...oh my God. 
The Himachi is the size of my ear.  I have big ears.
The rolls that use macadamia nuts...amazing
The prices?  Well, lets just say...you can pay with cash cause it is affordable.  NOT SF affordable, but like North Carolina affordable.  

My favorite SF sushi joint.  Period.  I can leave SF knowing that the entire city isn't about 50 dollar rotisserie chicken, 9 dollar scones, and 7 dollar coffee.   If i could afford it, I would eat this every day, die of mercury poisoning and pass away smiling.  The food is creative, generous, and well priced.  

5 stars cause if you don't try this...you will probably live your life thinking, "What if".

We went to Sushi Zone on a Friday afternoon around 5. We were first on the waiting list and waited about 45 minutes. It was worth it. I'll never forget the first time I tried one of their baked mussels. It is something that will be with me for a long, long time. The rolls are well-priced at $6 for the amount of food that you get. I recommend the ones with macadamia nuts on them...amazing. We ordered way too much food, but didn't overpay really. The same meal at Zushi Puzzle would have been $100 where we spent around $65 at Sushi Zone. 

This is definitely one of those places that makes San Francisco special.

One of my favorite spots in the city for sushi. Just amazing, no frills, fresh fish. The only downside is the size of the restaurant but I think that adds to its charm. If you don't want to wait, either come really early (5-530pm) or really late (9-930pm).

Recommendations:
-Baked mango sea bass: rich, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Get this
-Hawaiian #2: albacore, mango, macadamia nuts (don't be turned off...it's good)
-Spicy Hamachi: a staple and must-try
-Yellowtail & Scallion
-Salmon sushi

Prices: 
On the cheaper side which is awesome. Not a ton of cheap sushi places that is also backed by quality.

Atmosphere/Service:
Friendly staff, only about 2 sushi chefs are outside at a time. Don't wear anything you don't want smelling like fried food

I have nothing bad to say about Sushi Zone..just that the negative reviews are all BS ;)

Listed in: SF: So good it deserves to be…

still my favorite place in the city for sushi.  even with an hour-plus wait.

The baked sea bass is also amazing, as is the suzuki (that sauce is unreal).  

Started ordering the Spicy Hamachi a lot too.  (and I still go with the Hawaiian #1 and #2 and the baked mussels every time)

Hands down the best Suhi ive ever had. The spicy mussel roll made me want to kiss the chef and the 6.50$ price made me want to dap up the owner. Make sure to come with some time on your hands because the place is small and the demand is high. This will be the first place I eat the next time i'm in the Bay.

I love sushi restaurants that have old Asian chefs that dont speak english and only understand roll names, I think they're so cute =)
The sushi here is fantastic! 
I have had better in my vast years alive, but this one is definitely up there.
When i crave some raw fish meat I usually come here with a few fellow carnivores of mine =) 
I try to get different things from the menu each time just to say I tried everything at least once.
Here is what I tried my last time ( yes i remember what i got).
-Spicy Hamachi Roll - 5 Stars
-Saba Gari Maki - 4 Stars
-Spicy Tuna Roll (one of my usual rolls) - 6 Stars!
-Baked Mango Seabass - 4 stars

Everything was totally delicious, I'll update my review of my next experiments soon!

Some of the best sushi I've ever had.

Everything was fresh, the flavor was excellent, and the atmosphere was tons of fun. We waited quite a while for a seat, but that's part of it.

Can't wait for next time.
