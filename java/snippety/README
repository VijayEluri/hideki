1. Files and directories
	/src		- source code directory
		/codetest	- package for this project
			/Snippetty.java			- the code to generate snippet from document and query
			/SentenceFeatures.java 	- sentence information to rank sentences in document in case of multiple match
			/Demo.java				- demo code (stdin -> document, command parameters -> query)
	/test-src	- junit test source code directory
		/codetest
			/SnippetyTest.java		- Unit Test
	/data		- data directory for demo
		/sushizon_yelp.txt	- document for demo (Sushi Zone is top ranked search result for the query "sushi bar / san francisco CA")
	Makefile	- makefile for compile, junit test, and run demo
	README		- this file
	
2. Compile, demo, and unit test
	a) for JUnit, please update JUNIT_CLASSPATH variable in Makefile
	b) "make jar"  - compile and create jar file
	c) "make demo" - demonstrate summary functionarity with using demo document and demo query
		demo document - "Sushi Zone" which is top ranked yelp result for the query "sushi bar / san francisco, ca"
		demo query  - "sushi bar"
	d) "make test-compile" - compile unit test codes
	e) "make test" - execute unit tests
	
3. Definition of snippet (summary)
   a) Sentences is better than a list of keywords for snippet.
   b) Snippet contains one or two sentences. Or it could contain three. (My code is adjustable by modify constant variable)
   c) Maximum length of each sentence is 100 (adjustable). If sentence is longer than 100, it is truncated by 100 with replacing "...".
   d) Summary sentences need to contain at least one of query words.
   e) Query words in a snippet must be highlighted.
   f) If many sentences contains query words, most relevant sentences must be selected as summary.
   g) Features to select relevant sentences:
   		1. Sentence position in the document.
   		2. Matched query word frequency.
   		3. Completeness of query word in the sentence. Ex) Sample query, "deep dish pizza" is in a sentence.
	h) In case that a document does not contain any query word, summary is first one or two sentences of document.
	i) In case that query is empty, summary is first one or two sentences of document.
	j) In case that document is empty, summary is "".
